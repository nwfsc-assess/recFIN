# RecFIN
Working with recreational data for the US West Coast from
Recreational Fisheries Information Network
([RecFIN][]).

We support the efforts of the
Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission ([PSMFC][])
to provide a clearing house for recreational sampling data collected over the
years along the US West Coast.
This package is meant to work with this data.

## Glossary

* MRFSS: Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey
* [PSMFC][]: Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission
* [RecFIN][]: Recreational Fisheries Information Network

## State Sampling Programs
Each state collects data from their recreational fisheries which is then transmitted to RecFIN:

* [CRFS](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/CRFS): California Recreational Fisheries Survey
  * [CRFS Sampling Protocol Manual](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=62348&inline)
  * [CRFS General Information](http://wiki.recfin.org/index.php/California_Recreational_Fisheries_Survey)
* ORBS: Oregon Ocean Recreational Boats Survey
  * [ORBS Sampling Design](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/salmon/docs/ORBS_Design.pdf)

## Installation

Installing RecFIN requires the use of
[devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) or
[remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes).
The latter is a dependency of the former so you can just install
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)
from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Install the most recent, stable version of the package from
github using

```
remotes::install_github("nwfsc-assess/RecFIN")
```

## Usage

Reading in recreational fisheries data can be done with the
`RecFIN::read_*()` functions.
The `read_*` functions automatically clean the data and work towards
providing consistent column names such as Year instead of YEAR.
Consistency is key because there are so many providers of data when
it comes to recreational fisheries. Users can also clean their data
themselves using the `RecFIN::clean_*()` functions.
